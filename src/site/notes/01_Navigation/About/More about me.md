Hello hello! Twiggs (You can call me Brandon) If you're on this page that means you came here from the [[01_Navigation/Welcome to Twiggs Digital Graden!\|start page]]

I live in the city of Umeå in Sweden; perhaps you've seen the[ viral video ]( [Is this the most unusual sound in the Swedish language? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URgdIAz4QNg))by *The Local* published in 2015. Yep, that's where I have lived since 2005.

As of September 2023, I am a student studying the masters course for "Spatial Planning & Sustainability" at Umeå University  [^1] with a BA in Human Geography and Urban Planning [^2] at the same instution.

In my free time, I like playing video games, optimizing my life through the use and application of new and emerging technologies. On the occasion that there's enough interest and money, I love to travel and meet people all over the world.

Biggest one though?

I'm a HEMA [^3] practitioner since 2017 with zero medals under my belt but plenty of passion for the art of swordfighting, where you can find some of my highlights on[ YouTube. ](https://www.youtube.com/@Twiggstube). I practice Meyer-style longsword fencing and Swedish sabre.

If you want to find me, here you go. I'm not gonna show a picture of what I look like, see the links below….
