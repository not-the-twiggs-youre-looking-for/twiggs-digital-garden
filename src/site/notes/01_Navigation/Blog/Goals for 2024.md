You know, I've never really sat down and tried to document or at least verbally express (for myself) what I want for myself in the coming year. This isn't a good strategy to go about life.

Now that we're moving into 2024, I realize that it's very important for me to not only present my own goals, desires, wishes, and thoughts to myself, but also to the Internet. Because if I think about it this way, [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/the future me is a stranger\|the future me is a stranger]] to this content. I suppose I have gained a lot of wisdom over the years of being an insane failure at life. I've had a lot of regrets, missed opportunities, and untapped potential in my life. And now, as my university degree is ending this coming semester in June, and I'm officially unemployed with no safety net at all, I think it's time for me to face the consequences and actually fix the mess that I made for myself during this year. And these fixes can come in a variety of different ways.

# Goals for 2024

### Publish and Create
### I want to Create Youtube Videos
Ever since I can remember, I've had a strong addiction to consuming information on YouTube. However, I've never had the courage to step up and create something of my own, especially when it comes to visual content.

But now, with the emergence of new AI technologies like DESCRIPT, voice-to-text editing features, and powerful editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve, I have no excuse not to publish something at least once a month. I have countless ideas that have been brewing inside me, thoughts that I've struggled to document or even explore due to my inability to express myself through writing or creative endeavors. This leads me to my second point.

### I want to Publish My Thoughts out on the Internet

I've always been inspired by Gwern and the way he structures his blog. It's peculiar because I'm not particularly fond of social interactions, but reading his blog gives me a sense of intense attention and intimacy. It's as if I gain insight into his every thought. As we venture into 2024, I aspire to do the same. My mind is filled with countless ideas and thoughts that I haven't been able to process or share. This year, I'm fully committing to Obsidian as a tool to publish my thoughts. I won't sugarcoat it—I believe there will be significant value in putting this blog out there, whether it contains flattering or non-flattering things about me. I've come to realize that as an employer, what they're truly looking for in a fresh graduate like me is not solely academic merit, but also personality. And what better way to showcase that than by putting myself out there on the internet?


### Get Employed

Throughout my [[01_Navigation/About/More about me#Academics\|academical years]] but goof off to collect information that just goes straight through my head and goes nowhere. It is not used. It is not appropriately respected I'but goof off to collect information that just goes straight through my head and goes nowhere. It is not used. It is not appropriately respected I've gone into a lot of student debt. This and I know that the future me will probably look back at me today.   shake his head, and think what the hell – why?

Well, now that my academic career is over for now with my student loan and depths, increasing to an amount that I am not personally comfortable with and potentially may never be able to pay back,[^1] it is essential for me to live and succeed to get employed before summer.

### Move away from Home

I've always lived in the tiny Northern Swedish city of Umeå. I've grown up in the same apartment for five years, and before that, I lived in the basement of my parents' place. My life, to put it bluntly, has been a series of unproductive activities: nose-picking, video game playing, drowning in a VR addiction, and constant depression.

For a brief moment, I thought my life was changing in 2021. I finally had the opportunity to travel abroad for the first time in 2022. I spent a semester in Prague, and it felt like a breath of fresh air. But when I returned in February 2023 (as of writing this in December 2023), I found myself back in the same spot as before. I had hoped for a different outcome. I truly believed that by moving away, all my problems would magically disappear.

However, I've come to realize that true change doesn't happen until you distance yourself from familiar surroundings

So, my goal for 2024 is to make a big move. I don't care about the specific location, as long as it's not the same city where I've been stuck for so long. Whether it's a beautiful countryside with an amazing partner by my side or a completely different country altogether, it doesn't matter. What matters is that I find employment, happiness, and escape from the shittily stale spot I've been in.

All I want is to break free from all of this and be somewhere new.
