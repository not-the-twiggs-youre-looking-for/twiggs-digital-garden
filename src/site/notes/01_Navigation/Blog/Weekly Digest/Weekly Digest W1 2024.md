# Week in Summary

#### If You're Ever in Krakow. Do Yourself a favor , Buy Yerba Mate
#### I Accidentally Fucked up My Entire Obsidian Vault

* Don't install a ton of maangement plugins… especially if they are different ones working on the same thing. This includes playing around with Linter, Links and such all at once… without a backup [[0_Hidden & Private/9_Diary and stuff/Diary/DAILY/2024-01-02\|2024-01-02]]
* I never commited to restarting my vault fully from scratch, but now I've gone and removed **every single litterature note I've ever taken and made. Yay.** Why? Neither I, or anyone else would revisit them and find them genuinely useful. Prune if you don't use.[ [2024-01-03]]
