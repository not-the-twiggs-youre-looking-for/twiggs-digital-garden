# My Favorites This Week


# Shareworthy Stuff and Thoughts

### 1. Obsidian Cataclyst is now the First Program I Ever "donated" to
On December 20, 2023, I finally caved in and bought the [Obsidian Cataclyst](https://help.obsidian.md/Licenses+and+payment/Catalyst+license) license, just for the native tables editor, and oh my god, it's a game changer! Not having to rely on the Advanced Tables genuinely the final stop into going all-in on Obsidian.

Throughout 2023, I've been exploring the idea of migrating and importing everything into Obsidian, and so far, it's been quite successful. I've figured out how to set up plugins like Pandoc and Zotero integration to transition my entire workflow away from Google Drive docs and into Obsidian. I've already noticed several benefits, such as having a friciton-less all in one system and easily being able to create, refine and publish my work and thoughts, all in one system.

It's slowly becomign my go-to-program for everything, as I'm very hype on having everything in one place. It's become my go-to platform for publishing, thinking, and creative work…. and now my blog! I suppose it's also one of my [[01_Navigation/Blog/Goals for 2024\|Goals for 2024]]  move everything into Obsidian for good, and the elimination of having to go to an external source to format tables, or use a relatively clunky plugin through the insider update, just removed that pain point all-together. Yay!


### 2. Steam Weekly Review in 2023


So I just got my yearly steaming review page for this year and wow, there are so many things that I can look back on and smile looking back on. over a year I have exclusively played on my steam deck because I realized the [[convenience is king\|convenience is king]] not raw horsepower. and so I decided to even sell my gaming PC and I made a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/mYSoLCWkLrE) about that a long time ago in my YouTube page.

I expect now that I finally manned up and dedicated myself to actually posting my thoughts and putting myself out there that I can finally do commentating on games and my thoughts on them as well. Anyways, here is the year in review

### Test Note Please Ignore

Below is just a quick experiment to see if my private diary notes can be shown using transclusion on public notes. if this works this mean I don't have to mass-spam new notes from my private folder or do clunky shit all-together

### Test heading let’s see if it gets this 
Not having to rely on the Advanced tables  it so much easier for me just to effort to use everything in one program. because this is my native publishing, thinking and creative platform. I am so incredibly excited to see what other native features are important. I am using Obsidian for a majority of my academic writing my diary, as well as just everything in life in general, so I really wonder.
