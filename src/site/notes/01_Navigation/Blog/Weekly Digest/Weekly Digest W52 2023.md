# Week in Summary
### Started My 3-week Vacation in Poland

This is the fourth time I've visited Poland this year, marking Wroclaw, Krakow, Warsaw and Gdansk on my list. I am starting to fall so deeply in love with this country and the people in it.

### Meditations on My Last Year

I'm drunk as heck writing this, but why not. Got to end the year the way I started it, as per tradition right?

3 Regrets I have this year

##### I Regret Causing Trouble and Pain to My Loved Ones

##### Despite Having All of the time in the World, I Never Chased My goals…
Instead I kept drinking my ass to bed most of the nights, to (just like tonight, as of writing 05:07), being in a state where I try to keep the anxiety of tomorrow and of yesterday at bay. There are many days like these in particular that I vaugely remember, where I was paralyzed by the fear of doing anything; the fear of thinking and of feeling. What did I do instead of meeting the anxiety head-on?

I drank. I gamed. I scrolled Facebook/Instagram/Reels.
I've been trying to rewrite this paragraph three times now trying to get what I wanted to say out on paper. Again, I'm drunk as hell, so bear with me. Nothing has made me feel more inhuman this year, than going into a general decline in life after having spent the best semester of my entire 25 years on this planet in Prague. I was the rockstar. I was everything I never was, and the person I've only hoped to be in my life. I used to wake up at 7 every morning, (not trying to[^1]) making every second count. The life of a 25 year old taken back the span of 4.5 months.

Now what?

I'm drunk in an apartment in Krakow, anxious about the future. Where even the smallest of upsets send me into a night-long spiral of past/future-anxiety. Sure, I'm not in little town Umeå anymore. I'm in Krakow, for another week. But then what? Back to my boring life of trying to make it through a magisters (read: masters, if I had the money for it) degree in Spatial planning that I don't care about, while at the same time trying to find the energy to not only apply for jobs in a field I've spent my life studying for – one I find of importance and that I actually want to do.
	In one week, I'll be waking up drunk, just as I have during the past year worrying about the future. Knee-deep in a puddle of unsent cover letters and job applications, knowing that just like the other 15 I've sent this week that I'll be rejected from in the next one.
Fuck that.

it's really time for a change. But with how my life looks right now, I can't see any way out by literally "up (those who know know)".

Anyways, back on topic. **To achieve the 2024 I really want, to achieve the my [[01_Navigation/Blog/Goals for 2024\|Goals for 2024]]**, I need to change.


I know what I need to change to do so (not discussed in the post, but I don't know if I have the mental, emotional or financial capacity to see it through to the end. But I suppose I will share more of my year as it goes on.

(*Hell, I Haven't couldn't even be arsed to post a new years post on instagram for the friends that do care about me or my whereabouts…..)

* Work on my goals. One job application per day. I already have the systems set to alleviate 90% of the mental block to writing them…. time to execute on those strategies.*
