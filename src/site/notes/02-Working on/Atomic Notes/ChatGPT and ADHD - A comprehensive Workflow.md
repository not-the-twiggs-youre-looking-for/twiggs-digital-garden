I'm insanely lazy. and so I'd say that I've really made a valiant attempt to integrate both the technologies that I've come from, let's say, the explosive boom of the AI revolution.

Because someone who has struggled with [[../Evergreen%20MOCS/MOC_ADHD.md\|../Evergreen%20MOCS/MOC_ADHD.md]] my entire life, [[02-Working on/Evergreen MOCS/ChatGPT-HUB ðŸ¤–\|ChatGPT-HUB ðŸ¤–]] has been an absolute gamechanger.

Is it like the big benefit of using?

Cognitive Offloading:

1. External Memory Storage: ChatGPT serves as my external memory storage. I can quickly jot down ideas, thoughts, and important information in the chat interface, relieving the burden of relying solely on my working memory.
2. Note-taking Assistance: ChatGPT helps me take organized notes during meetings, lectures, or when conducting research. It provides summarizations, highlights key points, and creates structured outlines, making it easier for me to review and retain information later.
3. Task Reminders and Tracking: ChatGPT assists me with task management by providing reminders for important deadlines, appointments, and upcoming events. I can also track my progress on tasks and projects within the chat interface, ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks.

Creative Brainstorming:

1. Idea Generation: ChatGPT is an excellent tool for generating new ideas and expanding my creative thinking. I can have open-ended conversations with ChatGPT, exploring different perspectives, and receiving suggestions and prompts for my creative projects or problem-solving challenges.
2. Divergent Thinking: ChatGPT's ability to generate diverse responses fosters my divergent thinking. It provides alternative viewpoints, unconventional solutions, and helps me think outside the box, leveraging my propensity for unique and unconventional ideas.
3. Inspiration and Exploration: ChatGPT serves as an endless source of inspiration. I can discuss my interests, passions, or creative pursuits with ChatGPT, which provides relevant information, recommends resources, and shares examples from various fields, nurturing my creativity and fostering exploration.

Information Retrieval:

1. Quick Fact Checking: ChatGPT assists me with quick fact checking and provides accurate information on a wide range of topics. I can ask questions, clarify doubts, and receive concise answers, saving time and effort in searching for information through traditional means.
2. In-depth Research Assistance: When I need to delve into a specific topic, ChatGPT helps guide my research. It suggests keywords, provides relevant sources, and offers insights to kickstart my exploration, facilitating a more focused and effective learning experience.


The thing is that when I need to dive into a certain topic, my mind. is stuck. Stuck in generating an idea and getting started. You know, sort of that brain fog that you have in your head when you're trying to think of a subject, but you can't describe it any in any words. when it comes to even something as simple as googling or finding out information. I find that it's very much like starting a new essay or a new paper. You're met with a blank page and you just don't know what to do or write.

And so, ChatGPT becomes an incredible tool for generating a rough draft of my thoughts and ideas. It allows me to freely write, capturing all my initial concepts, without worrying about structure or perfection. Similar to the common advice in writing, I can just write, write, and write, knowing that I can later refine and create offshoot topics from that initial draft. It provides a space where I can let my ideas flow without constraints, helping me express myself and unleash my creativity. Whether I'm working on a written piece or trying to articulate my thoughts, ChatGPT serves as a valuable companion in the process of exploring and developing my ideas.


5. Learning Companionship: ChatGPT is a supportive companion during my learning process. It engages in educational discussions, explains complex concepts, and provides context and background information, enhancing my comprehension and retention as I navigate my [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/ADHD\|ADHD]] challenges.

I want to express my honest opinion: I find school unnecessarily complicated. It feels like it's more complex than it needs to be. Picture this: a teacher standing at the front of the classroom, explaining a concept or theory using convoluted academic jargon that most people struggle to understand, even after years of trying to grasp it. The problem, in my view, lies with the teachers. They often stick strictly to the book and fail to recognize that not everyone comprehends information in the same way. Throughout my years in education, I've seen numerous instances where this has been proven.

Good teachers don't simply regurgitate information from a book or use obscure language to explain concepts. They don't assume that stating a concept once is enough for students to grasp it. Let's take a moment to consider how our own brains function. When we encounter new information, we don't just accept it at face value and process it mechanically. We are not machines. Instead, we rely on analogies and comparisons. For example, when studying history, we don't merely learn a series of numbers; we delve into the stories behind them and learn what it was like for those people.

Now look back at your own experience is the class. Did your teacher do this?

Truth be told, probably not. But you see, this is where chat GPT has shown to be insanely beautiful to me. Because of its LLM-nature, It has the ability to take. obtuse pieces of information and theories and concepts and break it down not only into something relatable and understandable for our pea monkey brains.
