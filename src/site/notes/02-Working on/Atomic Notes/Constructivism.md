ðŸŽ“ Constructivism essentially postulates that **truth is** **constructed and subjective reality (re)created through individual and collective perceptions and interpretations of the reality.

Constructivism differs from [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Subjectivism\|Subjectivism]] in the way where knowledge (and scientific) and reality is **actively constructed by individual or community-based frameworks, from social and cultural influences** around us.

Together as they solve this puzzle, they construct the reality and understanding of the world/question is an **amalgomation of different contributions.**

In summary, subjectivism primarily focuses on the individual's subjective experience and interpretation as the basis for knowledge and reality. Constructivism, on the other hand, emphasizes the active construction of knowledge by individuals or communities, stressing the role of social and cultural influences in shaping our understanding of reality.

**Both methods are subjective**

Essentially this philosophy is all about "there are many realities, and your understanding and worldview can be understood as a whole and different from other" â€“ essentially but it is different from

| Aspect          | Constructivism                              |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Epistemology** | Highlights the active construction of knowledge by individuals or communities. It posits that knowledge is a product of human interpretation, social interactions, and cultural contexts. It acknowledges that our understanding of the world is constructed rather than discovered. |
| **Ontology**     | Acknowledges the existence of an external reality, but argues that our understanding of this reality is constructed and shaped by human perceptions, interpretations, and social interactions. There might be an objective reality, but our access to it is mediated by human interpretation and constructions. |
| **Methodology**  | Acknowledges that scientific theories and knowledge are human-made constructions. It emphasizes the role of social, cultural, and historical factors in shaping scientific understanding. Recognizes the importance of collaborative efforts, multiple viewpoints, and the evolution of theories over time as new information emerges. |
