Key aspects of critical realism:

1. **Reality and Layers**: Critical realism acknowledges that there are multiple layers of reality. It distinguishes between the empirical (observable) realm, the actual (underlying causal mechanisms), and the real (unobservable structures that produce the observable).

2. **Epistemology**: It suggests that while we might not fully grasp the real structures underlying the observable world, we can understand them to some extent through inference and theory-building. Our knowledge is limited but can be improved by exploring the underlying causal mechanisms.

3. **Critical Emphasis**: The "critical" aspect denotes a critical stance towards the limitations of our knowledge and the biases present in how we understand the world. It encourages continuous critical examination of the methods used in scientific inquiry.

4. **Interaction between Social Structures and Individuals**: Critical realism emphasizes the interaction between social structures and individuals. It acknowledges that individuals operate within social structures and that these structures influence and shape individual experiences.

5. **Contextual Understanding**: It supports the idea that knowledge and reality are context-dependent and can be influenced by social, historical, and cultural factors.


In summary, critical realism tries to reconcile the existence of an objective reality with the understanding that our knowledge is always limited. It emphasizes the need to critically assess and develop our understanding of the world by acknowledging the interplay between observable phenomena and underlying causal mechanisms, social structures, and individual experiences.


| Aspect          | Critical Realism                            |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Epistemology** | Acknowledges an objective reality exists independent of human perception but argues that our knowledge of this reality is constrained by our perceptions and theories, aiming to uncover underlying causal mechanisms. |
| **Ontology**     | Posits that an objective reality exists and can be known, but our understanding of this reality is mediated by our perceptions and theories; it recognizes the existence of an external reality beyond our interpretations. |
| **Methodology**  | Supports the use of both empirical observation and theory-building, acknowledging that while we can never have a complete understanding of reality, we can develop theories that approximate the underlying causal structures. |


Another aspect of the epistemology is that it's imbued with power imbalances such as well

**
Realism vs. Constructivism**:

- Realism emphasizes an objective reality that exists regardless of human interpretation.
- Constructivism, in contrast, suggests that reality is shaped by human interpretation and is actively constructed by individuals or communities. It highlights the role of social, cultural, and historical factors in shaping our understanding of reality.

**Realism vs. Positivism**:

- Realism acknowledges the existence of an external, objective reality.
- Positivism focuses on empirical observation and the verification of knowledge based on observable data, often without making strong claims about the nature of reality beyond what can be observed or measured.

**Realism vs. Subjectivism**:

- Realism maintains that there is an objective reality beyond individual perception.
- Subjectivism emphasizes that reality is subjective and shaped by individual experiences, suggesting that there might not be an external reality beyond one's subjective experiences.


In summary, realism stands apart from other scientific philosophies by affirming the existence of an objective reality, independent of human perception, while other perspectives might emphasize the role of perception, construction, or verification in shaping our understanding of the world.

Imagine realism as a way of thinking that says social reality (like rules, cultures, and institutions) exists in two parts: things you can't see directly (like deep social structures) and ideas (like thoughts and beliefs). Strong realism thinks the unseen stuff is more important, while moderate realism sees both hidden things and ideas as equally important in shaping our world.

meanwhile, the opposite of this is constructivism is like saying our ideas, values, and norms create the world around usâ€”what we believe shapes our reality. **Realism, on the other hand, suggests that there's a hidden part of our world we can't directly see, such as deep structures and mechanisms, which also influence how things work, not just our thoughts and beliefs.**

Essentially, the comparison between the critical realism and realism is just in the way the critique the unobserable reality.


| Questions   | Strong Realism                                      | Moderated Realism                                   | Explanation                                                                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Q1on**    | Social reality includes unobservable social structures, and ideational factors are important. | Social reality contains both ideational and material dimensions, treating both equally. | Discusses the nature of social reality and its constituents.                                  |
| **Q2on**    | Agents confront social structures but are not entirely determined by them. Acknowledges human uniqueness and individual capabilities. | Agents confront and transform social structures, possessing varied capabilities. | Explores the relationship between human agency and social structures.                            |
| **Q3ep**    | Research focuses on underlying mechanisms that produced outcomes, interested in social structures specifically. | Identification of a wide range of mechanisms, predicting certain social phenomena. | Discusses the nature of social exploration, mechanisms sought, and the predictive aspect.        |
| **Q4ep**    | Knowledge is produced through a social process, correspondence theory of truth is endorsed. Truth claims are fallible and subject to revision. | Correspondence theory of truth is adopted, acknowledging truth claims as fallible. | Addresses the type of knowledge production, the truth claims' nature, and their fallibility.    |
| **Q5ax**    | Emphasizes the importance of research with emancipatory potential, exposing unfair social structures or prevailing false ideas. | Research should focus on explanation rather than emancipation or critique. | Discusses whether researchers should focus on emancipation, critique, or purely explanation in research. |
