## List of Types

Neo-classical economics differs from other main economic philosophies in several ways:

1. **Classical Economics:** Neo-classical economics builds upon classical economics, but it emphasizes the role of individuals and their preferences more than classical economics, which focused on the aggregate behavior of the economy. Neo-classical economics also incorporates the idea of utility, which measures individual satisfaction.
	1. ## Neo-classic Economy

Neo-classical economics believes that:

1. Anyone can start a new business.
2. There are so many businesses that none of them have an advantage.
3. Everyone knows all the information about buying and selling.
4. The market takes care of itself, which helps society.
5. Prices are fair, and supply equals demand.
6. Because of competition, businesses don't make much profit, so things are cheaper for consumers.

3. **Keynesian Economics:** Neo-classical economics differs from Keynesian economics in its views on government intervention. Neo-classical economics generally advocates for limited government involvement in the economy, believing that markets will self-adjust to achieve equilibrium. Keynesian economics, on the other hand, argues for government intervention during economic downturns to stimulate demand and employment.

4. **Marxian Economics:** Neo-classical economics is fundamentally at odds with Marxian economics. While neo-classical economics embraces capitalism and the market economy, Marxian economics criticizes capitalism for its inherent class struggle and exploitation. Marxian economics calls for the overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of a classless society.

5. **Behavioral Economics:** Neo-classical economics assumes rational decision-making by individuals, while behavioral economics recognizes that people often make irrational choices due to cognitive biases and emotions. Behavioral economics incorporates psychology and cognitive science to better understand economic behavior.

6. **Institutional Economics:** Neo-classical economics tends to downplay the role of institutions in shaping economic outcomes. Institutional economics, on the other hand, places significant importance on the impact of social, legal, and political institutions on economic behavior and outcomes.

7. **Austrian Economics:** Neo-classical economics and Austrian economics share some similarities, such as a belief in the efficiency of free markets. However, Austrian economics places a strong emphasis on individual entrepreneurship, subjective value theory, and the role of time in economic decision-making.

In summary ,**neo-classical economics differs from other economic philosophies in its emphasis on individual choices, market equilibrium, and limited government intervention**. It stands in contrast to **classical, Keynesian, Marxian, behavioral, institutional, and Austrian economics, each of which has its own unique perspectives and policy prescriptions.**
