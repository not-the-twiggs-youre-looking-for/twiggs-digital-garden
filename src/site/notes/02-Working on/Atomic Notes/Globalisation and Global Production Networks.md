[[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Globalisation\|Globalisation]] is driven by [[0_Hidden & Private/Inbox System/Transnational and Multinational corporations\|Transnational and Multinational corporations]]). These networks are complex systems that encompass the entire process of creating products, from initial design to final distribution. GPNs go beyond simple supply chains and encompass every transnational operation and transaction, including raw material procurement, manufacturing, assembly, marketing, and distribution. Each of these components can take place in different geographical locations.

GPNs should be seen as dynamic networks that constantly evolve based on market demands, technological advancements, and geopolitical factors. Each stage of production in the network adds value, not just economically but also in terms of knowledge, skills, and technology.

The value within GPNs can be enhanced through three methods:

1. Process Improvement: An example of this is Toyota's implementation of the "Toyota Production System," which improved production efficiency through lean manufacturing techniques, reducing waste and optimizing workflow. Another example is Henry Ford's approach to factory production.

2. Product Improvement: Apple continuously innovates its product line, such as the iPhone, to offer enhanced features and quality, maintaining its market leadership and value within the GPN.

3. Functional Improvement: South Korea's transition from basic manufacturing to advanced technology and electronics, as seen in companies like Samsung and LG, is an example of functional upgrading. These companies moved into more skilled aspects of production, such as high-tech manufacturing and research and development, contributing significantly to the country's economic growth.

However, **GPNs can also have negative impacts, such as labor exploitation and environmental degradation, as seen in industries like jeans production and mass coffee consumption.**

GPNs have significant impacts on local economies. Some of these impacts include:

- Capital Injection: TNCs bring foreign capital into local economies, theoretically stimulating economic growth. However, the actual impact of this capital may be overestimated.
- Stimulation of Local Entrepreneurs: Local businesses can integrate into the GPN, benefiting from new market opportunities. TNCs may also lead to the creation of new local companies.
- Knowledge Transfer: TNCs can introduce new technologies and knowledge to local economies, but this depends on their willingness to share information.
- Job Creation: TNCs create both direct and indirect jobs in local economies. However, concerns arise regarding the quality of these jobs and potential displacement of existing jobs due to competition.
- [[0_Hidden & Private/Inbox System/Challenges for Sustainable Development\|Challenges for Sustainable Development]]: To sustainably benefit from TNCs and GPNs, local economies need regional upgrading. This involves not only acquiring knowledge (know-how) but also understanding the underlying principles and purposes (know-why).
