Carl Sauer (1889-1975) was an influential American geographer often considered to be one of the founding fathers of cultural geography. He is known for his work in the field of human geography, particularly his emphasis on cultural landscapes and the ways in which humans shape and are shaped by their environment.

Sauer believed that landscapes are not simply natural features, but rather the result of human interaction with the environment over time. **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">He argued that cultural practices, including agriculture, settlement patterns, and land use, leave lasting imprints on the landscape</mark>**. This perspective challenged the prevailing notion at the time that landscapes were primarily shaped by physical processes.

Sauer's ideas laid the foundation for the cultural landscape approach, which examines the relationship between humans and their environment from a cultural perspective. He emphasized the importance of studying the historical context and cultural significance of landscapes, as well as the role of geography in understanding human societies.

Throughout his career, Sauer made significant contributions to the study of cultural geography, agricultural geography, and historical geography. His ideas continue to influence geographers and scholars interested in understanding the complex relationship between humans and their environment.

**TLDR: Old man Carl sauer basically said fuck it and said that human interaciton has a lasting effect on cultural and social alndscapes in both interaction and all.**
