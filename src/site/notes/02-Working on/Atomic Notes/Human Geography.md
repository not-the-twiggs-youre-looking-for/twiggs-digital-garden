### Human Geography
Human geography explores the relationships between people and their environments, including topics such as population, migration, urbanization, cultural landscapes, and the impact of human activities on the Earth.

**Carl Sauer: Considered a pioneer in cultural geography, Sauer focused on the influence of human culture on the landscape and emphasized the importance of cultural landscapes and human-environment interactions.**

### Two Main Ways of Approaching Human Geography
In chapter 1 of Paul, J Cloake, they introduce to two main viewpoints on human geography research through an analogy being Carl and Linda they have different approaches. [@clokePractisingHumanGeography2004]

- **Carl's Approach**:
  - Emphasizes immersive fieldwork with minimal pre-planning.
  - Seeks intuitive understanding of regions through direct experience.
  - Less focused on structuredh questions; more open-ended exploration.

- **Linda's Approach**:
  - Represents modern, systematic research methodologies.
  - Uses structured tools like questionnaires, interviews, participant observation.
  - Aligns research with specific theoretical frameworks and research questions.

**Key Lessons and Opinions:**

- The chapter discusses the shift from Carl's traditional, exploratory methods to Linda's methodologically rigorous approach.
- This shift reflects broader changes in the discipline, including debates over the role of fieldwork, ethical considerations, and the impact of research on communities.
	- But like what?
- The author seems to advocate for a balance between these approaches**, recognizing the value of both immersive experience (Carl) and structured, theoretically informed research (Linda).**

These two modes of Research are fundamental to consider when conducting [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Qualitative methods in Human Geography\|Qualitative methods in Human Geography]]
