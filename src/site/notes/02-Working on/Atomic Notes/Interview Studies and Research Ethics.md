# Interview Studies, why and When?
### Chapter 1 - Paul J. Cloke: "The Changing Practices of Human Geography: An Introduction"

This chapter introduces the changing practices of human geography through the stories of two fictional geographers, Carl and Linda. Carl represents the traditional approach of immersive fieldwork, while Linda embodies the modern, systematic research methodologies. Carl's approach emphasizes direct experience and open-ended exploration, while Linda's approach involves structured tools like questionnaires, interviews, and participant observation. The chapter discusses the shift from Carl's traditional methods to Linda's rigorous approach, reflecting broader changes in the discipline. The author advocates for a balance between these approaches, recognizing the value of both immersive experience and structured research.

### Chapter 5 - Paul J. Cloke: "Talking to People"

Chapter 5 delves into qualitative research methodologies in human geography, with a focus on interviewing and questionnaire techniques. The chapter challenges the notion that qualitative methods are recent, highlighting their deep-rooted history in the discipline. It explores the historical context of qualitative methods, including early examples such as the use of field informants and questionnaires by North American geographers. The chapter distinguishes between interviewing by questionnaire and informal conversation, discussing the objectives of qualitative interviewing. It also addresses ethical and methodological considerations, emphasizing the importance of understanding the researcher-researched relationship and the impact of subjectivity on data collection and interpretation.

### Topic: Overview of Social Geographies

Social geographies encompass a range of theories and concepts that serve as "toolboxes" for explaining research findings. The concept of social construction plays a significant role in these theories. The approach to social geographies emphasizes the intertwining of theory and methodology, recognizing their simultaneous importance in research. Social geographies employ a diverse toolkit of methods, sharing commonalities with other areas of human geography while also being innovative and varied in their approach. Key features of social geographical research include engagement with people as primary subjects, a focus on specific features of place and space, and a commitment to conducting relevant research that positively impacts social issues and communities.

### Topic: Data and Methods in Social Geographies Research

Social geographies employ a wide range of methods, including secondary methods, statistical methods, surveys, individual and group interviews, mobile methods, observational methods, sensory and visceral methods, online methods, visual methods, textual methods, arts-based methods, and participatory methods. The choice of methods depends on the research questions and may involve quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods.

### Topic: Approaching Social Geographies Research

Foundational concepts in social geographies research include ontology, epistemology, methodology, and methods. These concepts shape the researcher's approach and are influenced by disciplinary, institutional, geographical, and social contexts. Participatory Action Research (PAR) is highlighted as an approach that emphasizes collaborative research with affected communities and non-hierarchical knowledge production.

### Topic: The Research Process in Social Geography

Ethical considerations are crucial in social geographical research. Researchers must promote the well-being of participants, respect their rights and dignity, ensure voluntary participation, maintain research integrity and transparency, and establish clear lines of responsibility and accountability. Data collection involves obtaining informed consent and organizing recorded data. Data analysis acknowledges the multiple and situated nature of knowledge, requiring rigorous systems of analysis and reflection on the researcher's positionality.

## Interview Studies, Are They Actually Useful and Objective?



# Asking Questions Does not Really Give Direct Access to the Individuals Brain
"Authenticity and the Interview: A Positive Response to a Radical Critique" by Emilie Morwenna Whitaker and Paul Atkinson (2019)<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> explores the radical critique, which challenges the assumption that interviews provide direct access to the private emotions and experiences of individua</mark>ls. The authors highlight the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">criticism of the romantic view that interviews reveal authentic voices and experiences, and they argue against the idea that interviews can unproblematically represent respondents' private thoughts and memories.</mark> They also discuss the responses by Hammersley and Silverman[@silvermanHowWasIt2017, @hammersleyInterviewDataQualified2017], who agree with some criticisms of interviews but find the radical critique too negative overall.

### Interviews Are Inherently Flawed

"Interview Data: A Qualified Defence Against the Radical Critique" by Martyn Hammersley [@hammersleyInterviewDataQualified2017] provides a defense against the radical critique of interview data. Hammersley challenges the overextension of the critique and advocates for a more balanced approach that acknowledges both the limitations and the value of interviews. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">He discusses the gathering of diverse insights through interviews, including access to personal narratives and understanding social dynamics</mark>. Hammersley also emphasizes the importance of critical analysis of discourse practices and contextual understanding in ensuring the reliability of interview data. The paper examines naturalistic and  views in the context of qualitative research.

"How was it for you? The Interview Society and the Irresistible Rise of the (Poorly Analyzed) Interview" by David Silverman (2017) critiques the overuse and poor analysis of interview data in qualitative research. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Silverman raises concerns about the reliance on interviews without rigorous analysis and the tendency to interpret interview data as direct reflections of respondents' internal states or experiences.</mark> He stresses the need for nuanced and critical analysis of interview data, including the analysis of social dynamics and performative aspects of interviews.

The paper also discusses the utilization of interviews for gathering societal insights and subjective interpretations, as well as the importance of viewing interviews as complex social interactions that construct knowledge.

Overall, these texts provide a nuanced understanding of the role and reliability of interviews in qualitative research. They highlight the importance of critical analysis, recognizing the performative nature of interviews, and understanding interviews within their social and interactional contexts. Interviews, when used with analytical rigor, can provide valuable insights into individual experiences and societal trends, although they should not be the sole method of data collection.
