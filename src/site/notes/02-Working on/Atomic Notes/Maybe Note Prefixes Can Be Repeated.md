Maybe Note Prefixes Can Be Repeated

You know, initially, I was quite adverse towards having a note-taking system. Almost all my notes started with the same keyword at the beginning. However, I've realized that as soon as I restarted my vault [[0_Hidden & Private/9_Diary and stuff/Diary/DAILY/2023/2023-12-18\|2023-12-18]]  from scratch, there were a lot of benefits to having such a system.

On one hand, I plan on having all of my atomic notes in one folder. The ability to have a bunch of different notes categorized almost alphabetically, rather than topically, allows me to easily sort through them in the list. It's not only that. Relating it back to the concept that "Notes Are Ideas to Be Repeated," it allows me to somehow form different sentence structures that help me bond certain concepts and notes together.
