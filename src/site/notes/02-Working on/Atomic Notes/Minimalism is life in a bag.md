Over the years of being a chronic over-packer, I've come to realize that true minimalism isn't about saving money or simply following a social media trend like Instagram's minimalist community. It's not about seeking validation or being "the shit" in any given movement. No, minimalism offers something far more profoundâ€”the freedom to live a life unburdened by excess.

Imagine having your entire life condensed into a single bag, or even just a few bags. This concept of minimalism grants an unparalleled sense of liberation, big focus  on when it comes to travel. Yum, so moving into 2024 I want to become more minimalist and one way we're doing that  it's done by doing travel in a one-bag way because [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/One-Bagging is the best way to travel in my opinion\|One-Bagging is the best way to travel in my opinion]].
