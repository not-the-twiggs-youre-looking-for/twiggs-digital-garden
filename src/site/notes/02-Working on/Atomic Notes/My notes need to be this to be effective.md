For my notetaking and publishing workflow I try to adhere to two principles of notetaking

Namely that
1. [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Good Notes Should Be Propositional and Repeatable\|Good Notes Should Be Propositional and Repeatable]]
2. [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Notes Need to Be Deeply Interlinked and Easily Discoverable\|Notes Need to Be Deeply Interlinked and Easily Discoverable]]
3. Notes need to be personal & [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/notes represent my language\|notes represent my own language]]


I've found that the traditional methods of [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Zettlekasten Doesn't Work for Me\|zettlekasten doesnâ€™t really work for me]].  Thus I need to innovate in some other way, because I do want a hassle-free workflow for my day to day life both for learning and publishing content.
