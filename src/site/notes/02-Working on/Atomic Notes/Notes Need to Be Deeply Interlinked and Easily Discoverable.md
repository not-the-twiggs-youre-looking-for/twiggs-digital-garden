I found a major problem when I've used obsidian over the years; **namely that the notes are never organized or used.** As Matuschak Writes; [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Notes tend to be transient\|Notes tend to be transient]]

Therefore, we use tags and wikilinks to easily discover what the notes are for and to symbolize relationships between different notes.

There is also an appeal in repeating the sentences, combinding this with the rule of notes needing to be [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Good Notes Should Be Propositional and Repeatable\|repeatable and propositonal]] **we** kind of **create a language for ourselves** in this vault, where different sayings, notes, writings and concepts all interlink for easy discoverability and such. This also makes the notes discoverable, through being repeated multiple times.

In the past I really subscribed to the theory of not repeating note names, but now I’m very much in favor of it. With the main principle being paring down the amount of potential notes you’d have to sift through, almost like a more natural language form of nested tags.
