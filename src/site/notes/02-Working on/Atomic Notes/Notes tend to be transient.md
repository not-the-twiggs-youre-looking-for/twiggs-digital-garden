As Matuschak Writes; the way the people go about writing notes usually is through scribbling down, random disassociated, notes, and information notes that are never linked together, or are relevant to each other at all.

One never tend to go back to them, but I think as we've seen here there are quite a few benefits to the note-taking system that we have.
