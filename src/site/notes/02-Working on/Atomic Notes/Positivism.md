**Positivism**: Relies on empirical evidence and scientific methods to verify knowledge. It emphasizes the importance of observable, measurable phenomena and aims to establish theories based on empirical observations and verifiable data. Essentially this is **mathematics, this is science.** This movement had it's origins in the 19th century (1800's and was championed most notable by [Auguste Comte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Comte)) and somewhat fundamental to developing sociology as a whole.[^1]

Positivism is a paradigm that emphasizes objectivity, knowability, and deductive logic. It operates under the assumption that society can and should be studied empirically and scientifically. Positivist researchers aim to abandon biases and values in pursuit of objective, empirical, and knowable truth.

### Ontology, Epistemology and Methodology

ðŸŽ“ In terms of , positivism is all about the fact that "what is real" can only be defined through scientific and empirical observations, that something that does not exist, can not exist or be measured directly
ðŸŽ“In terms of **Epistemology**, or the way the gain their knowledge â€“ it is based around empirical evidence that is obtained through observation and experimentation. Scientific knowledge is created by a sensory experience and theories need to be verifiable and based on observable data.
ðŸŽ“In terms of **Methodology**, Positivism postulates that scientific theories must be directly testable and verifiable through empirical observation. The validity and truth of a theory are seen as contingent upon its empirical verification or falsification.

Their viewpoint fundamentally differs from [Realism](<02_ Working Brain/00_Please-Process 1/Philosophy of Science, Realism>) which is all about that there is an objective truth, we need to find through scientific theory and such the truth of that.

### Strong or Weak Positivism

| Typology | Positivism | Constructionism | Realism |
|----------|------------|-----------------|---------|
| Strong   | Moderated  | Strong          | Moderated |
|----------|------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Q1: Defining feature of social reality?** | Ontological realism. Invariant regularities. Only the observable exists. | Ontological realism. Regularities are not invariant. Unobservable social phenomena may exist. | Ontological idealism: multiple social realities. Social constructs. Ontological realism: one social reality which is construed differently. Social constructs. Ontological realism. Deep structures. Ontological realism. Deep structures, but the ideational and agential are equally important. |
| **Q2: Human agency?** | Human beings have limited agency. Same as strong positivism. | Human action is a byproduct of social structures, power relations, etc. Human agency is situated. Human beings are always confronted by structures, yet exercise agency Same as strong realism. |
| **Q3: Aim of explanation?** | Goal to discover laws governing the social world. Symmetry between explanation and prediction. Covering law model. | Goal to discover probabilistic regularities. Less focus on prediction than explanation. | Goal to gain in-depth knowledge of social constructs and their impact. Does not relate to "the objective world". Goal to gain in-depth knowledge of social constructs and their impact. Mainly focusing on ideational aspects, but can relate to objective/material aspects. Goal to uncover causal mechanisms that mainly take the form of social structures. Goal to uncover causal mechanisms that take various forms. |
| **Q4: True knowledge?** | Correspondence theory of truth. Knowledge of observable phenomena can be certain. | Correspondence theory of truth. Knowledge is not certain. Unobservable phenomena can be knowledge objects. | Conventionalist theory of truth. Knowledge is never certain. No objective facts. Correspondence theory of truth. Knowledge is never certain and always conceptually mediated. Correspondence theory of truth. Fallibilism. Correspondence theory of truth. Fallibilism. |
| **Q5: Value-free knowledge?** | Value-free research is possible and desirable. Research can and should overall be value-free, but personal values may impact the choice of research topic. | The researcher's values inevitably shape the research. Research should "deconstruct"/"denaturalise". Value-neutral knowledge can be produced. It is not a prime research goal to "deconstruct"/"denaturalise". Research is not be value-free. It has an emancipatory potential. Research cannot be value free, but it should focus solely on explaining phenomena. |


In the context of positivism's perspective on social reality, it primarily focuses on identifying regularities in probabilistic forms, which reduces the optimism for accurate predictions. Strong positivism asserts the possibility of obtaining certain knowledge based on observation and the correspondence theory of truth. It advocates for fact-based, value-free research, detached from personal values and without moral or political stances. However, moderated positivism maintains the correspondence theory of truth but abandons the certainty of knowledge, allowing for unobservable phenomena understanding and accepting the researcher's influence in topic selection, aiming for problem-solving knowledge to enhance societal institutions.


Positivism, both strong and moderated versions, asserts an ontological realism, meaning that social reality exists independently of the observer. Strong positivism contends that only observable phenomena exist and are governed by invariant regularities, while moderated positivism acknowledges unobservable elements such as social structures and perceives regularities as more situation-dependent. Both versions assume that humans have defined character traits and limited agency, contributing to stable social reality. Strong positivism aims to uncover social laws and emphasizes prediction, utilizing methods akin to natural sciences. Moderated positivism also focuses on generalization but allows for more situational considerations and a softer approach to invariant regularities.
