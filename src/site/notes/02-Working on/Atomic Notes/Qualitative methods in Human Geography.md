**In-Depth Summary and Key Topics:**

Chapter 5  of[@clokePractisingHumanGeography2004]provides a thorough analysis of qualitative research methodologies in human geography, with a focus on the historical development and application of interviewing and questionnaire techniques.

- **Historical Context of Qualitative Methods**:
  - The chapter begins by challenging the perception that qualitative methods in **geography are a recent phenomenon, highlighting their deep-rooted history.**
  **- Early examples include North American geographers like [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Human Geographer Carl Sauer\|Human Geographer Carl Sauer]] using field informants, and Whittlesey's emphasis on questionnaires alongside observation.**

- **Interviewing Techniques**:
  - Distinguishes between "interviewing by questionnaire" and "interviewing by informal conversation."
  - Discusses the objective of qualitative interviewing, which is often to gather information about seasonal variations in farm practice or individual preferences in market centers.

- **Ethical and Methodological Considerations**:
  - Addresses the importance of understanding the researcher-researched relationship and adapting methods to specific contexts.
  - Emphasizes ethical considerations and the impact of the researcher's subjectivity on data collection and interpretation.

**Relevant Quotes:**
1. "In North America, there is evidence of a tradition of ‘talking to’ field ‘informants’..." (p. 30-31).
2. "C.M. Davis... distinguished between ‘interviewing by questionnaire’... and ‘interviewing by informal conversation’" (p. 523-525).
3. "The objective [of interviewing]...chiefly to ‘gather qualitative information...'" (p. 525).

## Qualitative Questionaires, which sampling method should one use for the data?


| Sampling Method   | Pros                                                         | Cons                                                         | Example of Use                                               |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Random Sample     | - Provides unbiased representation of the population        | - Requires good information about the total population        | Surveying a geographically concentrated population           |
| Systematic Sample | - Easy to implement and analyze                               | - May introduce bias if list contains regular patterns        | Selecting every 10th person from a membership list            |
| Stratified Sample | - Ensures representation of specific population characteristics | - Requires prior knowledge and grouping of characteristics   | Studying age or gender distribution in a population          |
| Multi-stage Cluster Sample | - Efficient for large, diverse populations | - Requires multiple stages of sampling | Sampling households within neighborhoods in a city |
| Purposive Sample  | - Allows targeting specific cases of interest                 | - Subjective selection by the researcher                      | Studying unique or rare cases of cultural practices          |
| Quota Sample      | - Allows control over sample characteristics                   | - May introduce self-selection bias                           | Surveying a specific age range or gender group               |
| Availability Sample | - Convenient and easy to implement                            | - May introduce self-selection bias                           | Collecting responses from people who voluntarily participate |

It's important to note that the choice of sampling method depends on the research objectives, available resources, and the characteristics of the population being studied. Here are some examples of when each method could be used:

- Random Sample: When studying a geographically concentrated population, such as residents of a specific city or neighborhood.
- Systematic Sample: When selecting a fixed percentage of individuals from a membership list, such as every 10th person.
- Stratified Sample: When studying specific population characteristics, such as age or gender distribution, and ensuring representation of those characteristics.
- Multi-stage Cluster Sample: When working with large and diverse populations, such as selecting households within neighborhoods within a city.
- Purposive Sample: When studying unique or rare cases of cultural practices that are of particular interest to the researcher.
- Quota Sample: When setting specific quotas for certain characteristics, such as surveying males and females between certain age ranges.
- Availability Sample: When collecting responses from individuals who voluntarily participate, such as through advertisements or online surveys.

These examples highlight the versatility of sampling methods and their applicability in different research contexts. Researchers should carefully consider their research objectives and the characteristics of the population to choose the most appropriate sampling method.
