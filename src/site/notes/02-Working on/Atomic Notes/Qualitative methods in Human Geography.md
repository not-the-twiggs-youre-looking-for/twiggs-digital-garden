## Qualitative Questionaires, Which Sampling Method Should One Use for the Data?


| Sampling Method   | Pros                                                         | Cons                                                         | Example of Use                                               |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Random Sample     | - Provides unbiased representation of the population        | - Requires good information about the total population        | Surveying a geographically concentrated population           |
| Systematic Sample | - Easy to implement and analyze                               | - May introduce bias if list contains regular patterns        | Selecting every 10th person from a membership list            |
| Stratified Sample | - Ensures representation of specific population characteristics | - Requires prior knowledge and grouping of characteristics   | Studying age or gender distribution in a population          |
| Multi-stage Cluster Sample | - Efficient for large, diverse populations | - Requires multiple stages of sampling | Sampling households within neighborhoods in a city |
| Purposive Sample  | - Allows targeting specific cases of interest                 | - Subjective selection by the researcher                      | Studying unique or rare cases of cultural practices          |
| Quota Sample      | - Allows control over sample characteristics                   | - May introduce self-selection bias                           | Surveying a specific age range or gender group               |
| Availability Sample | - Convenient and easy to implement                            | - May introduce self-selection bias                           | Collecting responses from people who voluntarily participate |

It's important to note that the choice of sampling method depends on the research objectives, available resources, and the characteristics of the population being studied. Here are some examples of when each method could be used:

- Random Sample: When studying a geographically concentrated population, such as residents of a specific city or neighborhood.
- Systematic Sample: When selecting a fixed percentage of individuals from a membership list, such as every 10th person.
- Stratified Sample: When studying specific population characteristics, such as age or gender distribution, and ensuring representation of those characteristics.
- Multi-stage Cluster Sample: When working with large and diverse populations, such as selecting households within neighborhoods within a city.
- Purposive Sample: When studying unique or rare cases of cultural practices that are of particular interest to the researcher.
- Quota Sample: When setting specific quotas for certain characteristics, such as surveying males and females between certain age ranges.
- Availability Sample: When collecting responses from individuals who voluntarily participate, such as through advertisements or online surveys.

These examples highlight the versatility of sampling methods and their applicability in different research contexts. Researchers should carefully consider their research objectives and the characteristics of the population to choose the most appropriate sampling method.

## Are Interviews a Good way of Doing It? Pros and Cons of Interviews



"Authenticity and the Interview: A Positive Response to a Radical Critique" by Emilie Morwenna Whitaker and Paul Atkinson (2019)<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> explores the radical critique, which challenges the assumption that interviews provide direct access to the private emotions and experiences of individua</mark>ls. The authors highlight the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">criticism of the romantic view that interviews reveal authentic voices and experiences, and they argue against the idea that interviews can unproblematically represent respondents' private thoughts and memories.</mark> They also discuss the responses by Hammersley and Silverman, who agree with some criticisms of interviews but find the radical critique too negative. The paper emphasizes the use of interviews in gathering personal narratives and understanding social phenomena, while also recognizing the performative nature of interviews and the need for analytical rigor.

"Interview Data: A Qualified Defence Against the Radical Critique" by Martyn Hammersley (2017) provides a defense against the radical critique of interview data.<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> Hammersley challenges the overextension of the critique and advocates for a more balanced approach that acknowledges both the limitations and the value of interviews. H</mark>e discusses the gathering of diverse insights through interviews, including access to personal narratives and understanding social dynamics. Hammersley also emphasizes the importance of critical analysis of discourse practices and contextual understanding in ensuring the reliability of interview data. The paper examines naturalistic and constructionist views in the context of qualitative research, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding of social phenomena.

"How was it for you? The Interview Society and the Irresistible Rise of the (Poorly Analyzed) Interview" by David Silverman (2017) critiques the overuse and poor analysis of interview data in qualitative research. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Silverman raises concerns about the reliance on interviews without rigorous analysis and the tendency to interpret interview data as direct reflections of respondents' internal states or experiences.</mark> He stresses the need for nuanced and critical analysis of interview data, including the analysis of social dynamics and performative aspects of interviews.

This summary covers three important texts about the use of interviews in qualitative research, each offering unique insights and critiques.

1. **"Authenticity and the Interview: A Positive Response to a Radical Critique"**
   - **Main Points**: This text addresses the radical critique of qualitative interviews, questioning their ability to access authentic experiences directly. It emphasizes the performative nature of interviews and the importance of rigorous analysis to understand these constructed responses.
   - **Key Contributors**: The paper includes responses from Hammersley and Silverman. Hammersley views the critique as overly negative and advocates for a balanced approach, while Silverman stresses disciplined analysis and warns against under-analyzed interviews.

2. **"A Qualified Defence Against the Radical Critique" by Hammersley**
   - **Focus**: Hammersley defends the use of interview data against radical critiques. He emphasizes the balance between recognizing the limitations and appreciating the value of interviews.
   - **Perspectives**: The paper discusses ethnomethodology and constructionism, contrasting them with naturalistic views. Hammersley argues for the importance of understanding the social and interactional contexts of interviews.

3. **"How was it for you? The Interview Society and the Irresistible Rise of the (Poorly Analyzed) Interview" by David Silverman (2017)**
[[../../99_System%20Folder/System%20Files/Zotero/References/@HowWasIt.md\|../../99_System%20Folder/System%20Files/Zotero/References/@HowWasIt.md]]
   - **Argument**: Silverman critiques the overuse and inadequate analysis of interviews in qualitative research. He challenges the assumption of authenticity in interview responses, advocating for more nuanced and critical analysis.
   - **Ontology**: The paper suggests a constructivist view, where knowledge is seen as socially constructed, including through interviews.

**[[@friedmannPlacePlaceMakingCities2014\|@friedmannPlacePlaceMakingCities2014]]**:
- Interviews in qualitative research should not be seen as direct gateways to authentic experiences but as performative acts that require rigorous and critical analysis.
- Both Hammersley and Silverman emphasize the importance of balancing the understanding of interviews' limitations with their potential value, particularly when used in conjunction with other methods.
- The constructivist ontology is a recurring theme, highlighting the role of interviews in constructing knowledge through social interactions.
