In 2022, I began experimenting with Voice Dictation on Windows 11, and it's become an essential part of my workflow.

For individuals with [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/ADHD\|ADHD]], it's a game-changer.

Here are some keyboard shortcuts to try:
- Windows: Win+H
- Mac OS: Voice button (see your settings)

 Both Windows and Mac (native OS) automatically detect punctuation,[^1] but you can use ChatGPT to refine voice transcripts into readable text *(and even help you polish it further).* As for Linux, I've explored options but haven't found any good substitutions, especially for being so effortly easy to use except for maybe[ mkioi’s dsnote]([^3]https://github.com/mkiol/dsnote).[^2] but like all FOSS software it's getting better and I'm more than open to suggestions for using voice dictation on Linux.

Using the Win + H shortcut on Windows is a game-changer, especially for those with ADHD symptoms. Microsoft's voice detection is incredible, effortlessly converting spoken words to text and just like MacOS, works globally across the entire OS. Sometimes, hickups occur, such as
* Misheard and mistranslated words
* Weird punctuations in liue of breathing breaks mid-sentence

But….

it get's you 80% of the way there, if you just speak clearly and [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/speak like you write and write like you speak\|02-Working on/Atomic Notes/speak like you write and write like you speak]]

Voice-to-text technology is amazing.
