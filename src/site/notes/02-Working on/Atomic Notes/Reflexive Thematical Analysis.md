# Reflexive Thematical Analysis
**Refactored from: [[99_System Folder/System Files/Zotero/References/@braunReflectingReflexiveThematic2019\|@braunReflectingReflexiveThematic2019]]**

The authors[@braunReflectingReflexiveThematic2019] made a change in their approach to Thematic Analysis (TA) by becoming more reflective. They started giving more importance to the subjectivity of the researcher and the need for reflexivity. Instead of considering TA as a broadly flexible method, they started leaning towards a more constrained approach, based on specific theoretical foundations. They also recognized that TA encompasses various approaches, each influenced by different philosophical assumptions and viewpoints.

They basically outline a few key principles of reflexive [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Thematical Analysis\|Thematical Analysis]]
First, it's essential to recognize the diversity of TA approaches and select one that aligns with your research purpose and theoretical framework.
1. **Researcher Subjectivity**: Emphasizing the role of researcher's subjectivity in knowledge production.
2. **Reflexivity**: Requires constant self-questioning and reflection throughout the research process.
3. **Theme Development**: Themes are seen as creative, interpretive stories created from data, not pre-existing elements to be discovered.
4. **Theoretical Knowingness**: Encourages researchers to be fully aware and transparent about their theoretical assumptions.
5. **Collaborative Analysis**: In multi-researcher projects, analysis is collaborative and reflective, aiming for a richer understanding rather than consensus.

# üßê Misunderstandings & Misapplications

- **Mashups with Other Approaches:** One common problem is the incorrect blending of reflexive Thematic Analysis (TA) with methods that are fundamentally incompatible, such as grounded theory. This can lead to confusion and potentially compromise the integrity of the research.

- **Conceptual Confusions:** Another challenge researchers face is the misinterpretation of themes. Some mistakenly see them as simple data summaries instead of recognizing them as patterns that convey shared meaning. This misunderstanding can hinder the depth of analysis.

- **Rigid Process Misconception:** There's a misconception among some researchers that reflexive TA follows a strict, linear process. In reality, it's meant to be an organic and iterative approach, adapting to the evolving nature of the data and research questions.
