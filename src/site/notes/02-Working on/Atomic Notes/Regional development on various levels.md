# Regional Development in Various Levels

## Regions as a Concept and Term
 Regions serve as an everyday arena for people, businesses, and activities, acting as a geographical level between the nation state and the local. They can be internally homogeneous or have certain ties that distinguish them from surrounding areas. Regions are commonly used as spatial units for statistical comparisons and analysis.

There are different types of regions, both micro and macro. Macro regions are large regions that can span several countries or continents, such as Scandinavia and the Middle-East. These regions often involve cooperation and trade blocs like the EU/EES and NAFTA. On the other hand, micro regions like the Northern Sparsely Populated Areas (NSPA) are regional cooperation initiatives that aim for sustainable development in economic, social, and ecological aspects, rich and universe in both resources, potential and people.

Regions are not entirely natural and are often constructed throughout history. They are dynamic entities that can change in shape, meaning, and content over time. "New regions" are often initiated by politicians and decision-makers to enhance regional development and increase competitiveness. Key factors in region-building processes include shared visions, regional identity, physical infrastructure, and common institutions. It's important to note that regions are not isolated and have networks and relations with other regions.

| Functional Regions                                                 | Regions connected by links and flows, with more interaction within the region than with surrounding areas |
