## Scientific Theory Basics
Scientific theory is a fundamental aspect of the scientific method, which is a systematic approach used by scientists to acquire knowledge about the natural world. A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is based on a body of evidence and has been repeatedly tested and confirmed through experimentation and observation.

The philosophy of scientific theory explores the underlying principles and assumptions of scientific inquiry. Scientists strive for objectivity, aiming to uncover objective truths about the natural world. However, we must also acknowledge the role of subjectivity and recognize that human perspectives and biases can influence the interpretation of evidence.


The way researchers have thought about science and the nature of thuth has changed over time.

### Ontology, Epistemology, Methodology

 Ontology, epistemology, and methodology are fundamental concepts in philosophy and research that help us understand the nature of knowledge, reality, and the methods used to acquire knowledge. Ontology explores the nature of reality and what exists, epistemology examines how we acquire knowledge, and methodology provides a framework for conducting research or inquiry. These concepts play a crucial role in various fields, including science and social sciences, influencing the understanding of scientific knowledge and the relationship between theory and observation.

| Concept     | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ontology    | Ontology explores the nature of reality and what exists. It is concerned with understanding the fundamental categories of existence and the relationships between them. |
| Epistemology | Epistemology examines how we acquire knowledge. It explores different theories and concepts related to knowledge, including rationalism, empiricism, and skepticism.    |
| Methodology | Methodology provides a framework for conducting research or inquiry. It involves selecting research methods, data collection techniques, and data analysis procedures.          |

These three concepts, ontology, epistemology, and methodology, are essential for comprehending the nature of knowledge, reality, and the process of acquiring knowledge in various fields of study. In addition, different  [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Scientific Theory#Different philosophical stances\|Scientific Theory#Different philosophical stances]], such as realism and positivism, have varying views on these concepts.

Furthermore, **axiology**, which focuses on values and ethics, plays a role in research methodology by considering non-anthropocentrism and the emancipation of both humans and non-human entities.

#### Dualism Vs Objectivism

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Descartes introduced dualism, which separates the mind and body as distinct substances</mark>. The mind is non-physical, while the body is physical. Objectivism, associated with Ayn Rand, emphasizes the objective reality of the external world. Both explore different aspects of reality and contribute to the philosophical discussion on the nature of existence and the mind-body relationship. This makes up the [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Scientific Theory#Ontology, Epistemology, Methodology\|Scientific Theory#Ontology, Epistemology, Methodology]]

### Different Philosophical Stances

In the pursuit of knowledge, scientists may adopt different philosophical stances. Some may be radical adopters of a particular philosophy, while others may take a more moderate approach, drawing insights from various philosophies. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of the complexities of scientific inquiry.

These axes attempt to capture key elements that differentiate these philosophical perspectives in terms of their perception of reality, source of knowledge, and relationship with science. However, the complexity and nuances of these perspectives may not be fully captured within a simple visual representation. Nonetheless, these axes can provide a general understanding of their differences across some common dimensions.


[[2KG301-1 - Lecture 1\|Aina Tollofsen]] essentially says that we may find ourselves, as researchers in either extreme of these philosophies, as a radical adopter of these philosophies or as a moderate, or <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">(my words) a fucking heathen taking some things from everything and being between everything.</mark>

Some key terms to be familiar with include positivism, which is the oldest form of scientific philosophy, and dualism vs objectivism, which explores the relationship between the mind and the external world. Different typologies of philosophy of science exist, each offering unique perspectives on the nature of scientific theory, from moderate to strong [@buch-hansenContendingPhilosophySocial2023]. Note that in these axises

Perception of realtity = ontology
source of knowledge = ontology

## How to Think about Science Changes over time â€“ History of Paragdim Shifts


- Social science has several predominant paradigms: [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Positivism\|Positivism]], interpretivism, social constructionism, critical paradigm, and postmodernism.  Each paradigm offers a different perspective on conducting research in sociology. See [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Scientific Theory#Different philosophical stances\|Scientific Theory#Different philosophical stances]].

- The quantitative revolution brought about a shift towards the use of quantitative methods in social science research.
- [[Marxism\|Marxism]] focuses on understanding society through power dynamics and class struggle.
- [[Modernism\|Modernism]] emphasizes rationality and objective truths, while postmodernism challenges the idea of objective truth and favors multiple interpretations.
- The [[Kuhn Cycle \|Kuhn Cycle ]]explains how scientific paradigms and theories evolve over time through crisis and the emergence of new paradigms.



- A paradigm is a way of viewing the world and understanding it.
- In social science, there are several predominant paradigms: positivism, interpretivism, social constructionism, critical paradigm, and postmodernism.
- Positivism is guided by objectivity, knowability, and deductive logic, aiming for a value-free sociology.
- Interpretivism focuses on understanding human differences and the meanings individuals give to social roles.
- Social constructionism sees truth as socially constructed and ever-changing, emphasizing social context and interaction.
- The critical paradigm focuses on power, inequality, and social change, challenging the idea of objective and value-free research.
- Postmodernism questions the existence of objective truth, emphasizing the subjective nature of knowledge and the role of power in shaping reality.
- Each paradigm offers a different perspective on conducting research in sociology.
- Researchers should consider the assumptions and characteristics of each paradigm when conducting their own research.

#### Quantitative Revolution Made People Think about Numbers

- The quantitative revolution refers to a significant shift in social sciences during the mid-20th century.
- It involved the widespread adoption of quantitative methods in research, enabled by advances in statistical techniques, data collection, and computing power.
- Quantitative research involves collecting numerical data and using statistical analysis to test hypotheses and draw generalizable conclusions.
- It allowed researchers to examine social phenomena at a larger scale and identify patterns that may have been overlooked using qualitative methods alone.

**source**:  [Quantitative revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_revolution)
#### Qualitative Revolution
- Qualitative research is a research approach that focuses on understanding and interpreting social phenomena through non-numerical data.
- It involves methods such as interviews, observations, and analysis of texts and documents.
- Qualitative research aims to uncover rich and detailed insights into individuals' experiences, meanings, and social interactions.
- It emphasizes the context, subjective interpretations, and complexity of social phenomena.
- Qualitative research is often used to explore topics where quantitative methods may be limited in capturing the depth and complexity of human experiences and social processes.
[Qualitative research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research)

    The critical paradigm focuses on power, inequality, and social change. It challenges the idea of objective and value-free research, emphasizing the need for researchers to be aware of their own biases and the power dynamics in society. It aims to bring about social justice and challenge existing social structures.
