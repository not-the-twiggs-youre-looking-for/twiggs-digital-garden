**Subjectivism** may suggest that scientific theories and knowledge are heavily influenced by individual biases, perceptions, and subjective interpretations. It questions the existence of an objective reality beyond our subjective experiences and asserts that scientific "facts" are merely interpretations.

This differs from [[02_ Working Brain/00_Please-Process 1/Constructivism\|02_ Working Brain/00_Please-Process 1/Constructivism]] where knowledge is constructed  through social interaction and cultural influences, [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Subjectivism\|Subjectivism]] poses that truth and knowledge is created by individual and subjective experiences. Everything is subjective apart from individual perceptions.

Subjectivism asserts that knowledge is shaped by individual perspectives and experiences, while constructivism posits that knowledge is collectively built through social interaction and cultural influences. 

The truth is values and experiences, mediated. 

| Aspect          | Subjectivism                                |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Epistemology** | Emphasizes subjective experiences, individual interpretations, and biases as the primary influencers of knowledge. It suggests that knowledge is contingent upon the observer's subjective perceptions and beliefs. |
| **Ontology**     | Denies the existence of an objective reality beyond subjective experiences. Reality is seen as a product of the mind, and there is no independent truth apart from individual perceptions. |
| **Methodology**  | Accepts that scientific theories and knowledge are influenced by individual biases, subjective interpretations, and personal experiences. It questions the idea of an objective truth and emphasizes the importance of diverse perspectives. |
