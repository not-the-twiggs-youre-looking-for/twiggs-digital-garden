The Kuhn Cycle Evolution of Scientific Paradigms

The Kuhn Cycle, proposed by philosopher Thomas Kuhn, provides a model for understanding how scientific paradigms and theories evolve over time. According to Kuhn, scientific communities operate within a dominant paradigm, which represents a widely accepted theoretical framework and research methodology. However, as researchers encounter anomalies or unexplained phenomena within the dominant paradigm, a crisis ensues, leading to the exploration of alternative explanations. Eventually, a new paradigm emerges that better explains the previously unexplained phenomena and becomes the new accepted norm. The cycle of paradigm shifts continues as new theories continually challenge and replace older ones, driving the advancement of knowledge.
