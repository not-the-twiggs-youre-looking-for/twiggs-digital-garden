# Thematical Analysis
**Refactored from: [[99_System Folder/System Files/Zotero/References/@braunUsingThematicAnalysis2006\|@braunUsingThematicAnalysis2006]]**

Thematical analysises are a form of qualitative [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Qualitative Spatial Analysis\|research]] used in standing the central themes of an interview or a paper. according to [-@braunUsingThematicAnalysis2006a], their paper is great for why, hows and whens of  thematic analysis offers for analyzing qualitative data.

At its core, this approach revolves around identifying, analyzing, and interpreting patterns or themes within qualitative data. The process begins with a comprehensive data corpus, which encompasses all the data amassed for a specific study. Within this corpus lies the data set, a focused subset selected for detailed examination. Its adaptability to different theoretical frameworks and research questions makes it a valuable method in various research domains.

Themes can be identified at two levels:
* the semantic level, which deals with the explicit content of the data【14†source】
* the latent level, which probes deeper into the underlying ideas and assumptions

Thematical analysis somehow inherently assumes a level of subjectivity and aligns with two primary [[Ontology, Epistemology and Methodology – defining, acquiring and how to researching knowledge\|epistemological approaches]] approaches: essentialist/realist, focusing on direct theorization from the data, and [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Constructivism\|Constructivism]], which contextualizes data within socio-cultural frameworks (see: [@buch-hansenContendingPhilosophySocial2023]).

The  steps of conducting a thematic analysis include familiarizing oneself with the data, generating initial codes, and then organizing these codes into **potential themes**.  Or when analyzing a set the data you can start to identify themes in the data set that you're investigating and you can either an

This method's applicability across various research domains underscores its efficacy and flexibility, making it a critical tool for qualitative research. The methodology's adaptability to different theoretical frameworks and the breadth of its application solidify its standing as a valuable asset in the realm of research, extending its relevance far beyond psychology.
