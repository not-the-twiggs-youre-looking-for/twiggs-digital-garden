> The Zettelkasten system is a note-taking and knowledge management method developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann. It revolves around the idea of creating and connecting small atomic notes called "zettels" to facilitate the organization and generation of knowledge. **Each zettel contains a single idea or concept, along with a unique identifier and metadata.** These zettels are then linked together through a network of connections, allowing for nonlinear thinking and the emergence of new insights. **The Zettelkasten system promotes active reading, thoughtful note-taking, and continual revisiting and refining of ideas, making it a powerful tool for knowledge creation and discovery.**


I like this but it's too slow. Too many things to keep track of, instead I have my own system in Obsidian that works using the **Quick Add functionality.**

There are two major commands, as most of my notetaking and writing is often deriviative of whatever note I currently am on (hi [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Zettlekasten Doesn't Work for Me\|Zettlekasten Doesn't Work for Me]]), I often find myself diverging my ideas and thoughts from this note.

This workflow is divided in three ways, using my own [[01_Navigation/Blog/Unsorted/How I organize my Vault and blog\|vault terminology]] **I do agree that there is an insane amount of merit to using the zettlekasten system,**  the way that atomic notes work has it's merits, but for me the concept itself doesn't really work.
