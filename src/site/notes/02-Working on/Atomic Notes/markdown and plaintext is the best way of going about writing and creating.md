On December 20, 2023, I finally caved in and bought Obsidian Catalyst, and oh my God, it's a game changer! Not having to rely on the Advanced Tables makes it so much easier for me to consolidate everything into one program. Obsidian has become my go-to platform for publishing, thinking, and creative work. I'm incredibly excited to explore its native features further. I use Obsidian for a majority of my academic writing, diary keeping, and pretty much everything in life, so I'm genuinely curious about its potential.

In addition, I've decided that in the coming year (check out my goals for 2024), I'm going to try consolidating not only my note-taking system and general knowledge management but also my output system into a single platform. By eliminating the input step and being able to publish all my work through Atomic Notes, I can create content rapidly, especially with AI and voice-to-text assistance (see [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Rapidly dumping info with Voice-to-text and AI-editing to make notes fast\|Rapidly dumping info with Voice-to-text and AI-editing to make notes fast]]).

Throughout 2023, I've been exploring the idea of migrating and importing everything into Obsidian, and so far, it's been quite successful. I've figured out how to set up plugins like Pock and Soto to transition my entire workflow away from Google Drive docs and into Obsidian. I've already noticed several benefits, which align with what other authors have talked about.
