To become more articulate, it is more important to speak like I write, and to write like I speak.

If we write in the way that we speak the way that we structure our sentences oddly become more comprehensible to the reader, it is almost as if reading conversational writing is almost as if you ecome more comprehensible to the reader, it is almost as if reading conversational writing is almost as if you're talking to them directly.

Some people say "you shouldn't write the way you speak" and others say no. I argue that you should, especially in an academical context. I hate academical language, I hate it with a passion. It removes the human element from writing (and honestly, makes you a prone target for fake AI detectors).
