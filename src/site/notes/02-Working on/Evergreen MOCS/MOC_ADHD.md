This page will serve as a navigational entry into what I've learned about ADHD. Think about it as a MOC for the entire topic of my experiences and the things I've learned about [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD)


> [!Note] Defining ADHD
> ADHD, which stands for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects both children and adults. It's like having a brain that's constantly on the move, making it challenging to stay focused, organized, and regulate impulses. People with ADHD may struggle with attention span, easily getting distracted, and have difficulty completing tasks. They may also exhibit hyperactive and impulsive behaviors, such as fidgeting, restlessness, and difficulty waiting their turn. While ADHD can pose its challenges, it's important to remember that individuals with ADHD often have unique strengths and talents, and with the right support, strategies, and understanding, they can thrive and succeed in various aspects of life [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD)
