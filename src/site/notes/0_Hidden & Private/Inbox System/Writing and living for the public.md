1. Transparency, accountability, and credibility in my actions, learnings and decisions (especially important if I aim to become a knowledge worker)
2. Amount of opportunities to forge meaningful connections and build a supportive network *(hopefully someone out there is reading this, yay!)*
3. Chances of inspiring, teaching  others through this blog; showing journey of personal growth and valuable insights I've gathered. *(I'm also too lazy to make [[01_Navigation/Blog/Goals for 2024\|youtube videos]], this then becomes a suitable replacement)*
