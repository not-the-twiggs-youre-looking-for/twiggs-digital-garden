A new philosophy I'm trying is to allow my notes to represent my own language: where every note is not only written in my own words, are easy to reflect back on; representations of my knowledge-base and everyday usage of the topics I talk and write about.

Every single note and bi-directional link in this vault are intended to be written in a way that makes them [[02-Working on/Atomic Notes/Good Notes Should Be Propositional and Repeatable\|memorable and easy to recall]], almost like a mantra. This makes it possible to repeat the title and instantly understand the concept or topic covered in that note. Additionally, these propositional titles also facilitate linking different topics together, creating a more interconnected knowledge base.
